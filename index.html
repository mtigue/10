	<h3>Grace</h3>
	<p>The Sacrament of Confession (also called Penance or Reconciliation) is primarily about grace, love, and forgiveness. God loves us unconditionally and is always sending his grace and love to us. </p>
		<p>Every moment, from every direction, grace is being sent to you. However, you can make a decision about how open you are to receiving this grace. You can also ask for more grace and help receiving grace.</p>
	<p>
	Take a moment now to ask God for more grace and for an awareness of his loving presence.
	</p>

	<h3>4 parts to Confession</h3>
	<p><strong>The Sacrament of Confession is made up for four essential parts.</strong></p>
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Sorrow: </strong>In order to be ready for the sacrament of 
	Confession, you need to be sorry for your sins. However, there are two types 
	of being sorry. One: You are afraid of the consequences of having sinned. Two: You really truly feel bad and don't want to sin again. As long as you are at least a little bit sorry 
	in either of these ways, the sacrament will provide you grace and reconciliation.  <br><br>
	</li>
	
<li><strong>Confess: </strong>You have to say your sins out loud to a priest in person. 
<br><br> </li>
<li><strong>Absolution:</strong> The priest says the words of absolution (forviness) to you out loud, in person.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Penance:</strong> During Confession, the priest will give you 
prayers or actions to do after you leave the confessional. These prayers or actions are a way for you to show God you are sorry and are trying to make up for your sins. 
Jesus death on the cross is what truly makes up for our sins, but doing an act of penance allows us to make an offering with Jesus.</li>	
	</ol>

<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Brief History of Confession</h3>
	<p>"Why and how did anyone ever begin to confess their sins 
	to a priest in the first place?" In John 20:21 Jesus said to his Apostles 
	"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you. Receive the 
	holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you 
	retain are retained". Jesus gave his Apostles the ability to exercise 
	forgiveness in His name. Only God can forgive sins. </p>
	
	<p>
	Baptism forgives all past sins and initiates us into the family of God. But, 
	what if a baptized person intentionally ends his or her relationship with 
	God and the Church? How can this person come back to the Church? Well, the 
	primary purpose of the Sacrament of Confession is to reconcile those who 
	have left the Church and severed their relationshipw with God. 	</p>
	<p>
	However, with time, Christians realized that they could receive the graces 
	of Confession even if they didn't completely break their relationship with 
	God. They could go to Confession 
	to repent of lesser offenses (venial sins) and to receive forgiveness, guidance, and the grace to not sin again. 	</p>

<span class="smallest">(CCC# 1446-1448)</span>

</div>


<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Do I Need a Priest?</h3>
	
	<p>
	Some people say that they don't need a priest and that they can talk directly to Jesus. Well, 
	we can talk directly to Jesus! But, if you were in a big room at a party and Jesus were there, would you rather talk to him quietly in your mind or rush over and talk to him in person? Confession is not an alternative to 
	talking to Jesus. Confession is an extra special way to 
	talk to Him and receive forgiveness through the successors of his Apostles. 
	We should talk to Jesus in private and go to Confession. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Another reason 
	Confession is helpful is because when we sin, we are in some 
	small way affecting or offending everyone in the great big family of God. It 
	would be too hard to go around and say sorry to all human beings that have 
	every lived, so the priest also represents the entire human family. By confessing to 
	the priest, you are confessing to Jesus and to humanity. 
	</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Ongoing Grace</h3>

	
	<p>
	Confession has the power within it to help you 
	stop sinning. It isn't just about forviveness. It is also about change and 
	renewal and never being the same again. 
	</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	...the sacrament of Reconciliation with God brings about a true, "spiritual resurrection," restoration of the dignity and blessings of the life of the children of God, of which the most precious is friendship with God. <span class="smallest">(CCC# 1468, Lk 15:32)</span>

	<h3>About This App</h3>

	Great care was taken to remain faithful 
	to the teachings of the Catholic Church when creating this app. However, the app should be seen as one of many possible guides to self-examination and Confession preparation. No one app can fully cover or express the rich traditions of the Catholic Church. 
	We believe all Bishops will find the content in keeping with the tradiations of the Catholic Faith. If we have failed 
	to do so in any way, we will quickly 
	ammend and 
	update the app.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We would love for you to keep in touch with us. We have many more apps, 
	programs, and resources planned. To stay on the cutting edge of cool, 
	Catholic technology, please use the form below.

	<p>Preparing for Confession often includes examining your conscience. Click through the following 10 commandments and allow the Holy Spirit to remind you of any sins you have comitted. If you'd like to make a note of a particular sin to help jog your memory during the actual Confession, you can put a check next to the question. 
	<p>
	When you press the button at the very bottom of the page, the app will move all of your checked sins to the "Guide to Confession" page. Make sure you click "erase sins" on the Guide to Confession page to clear the check marks on this page.  </p>

<div class="guide-section">

<h3>Blessing</h3>

<p>
When it is your turn for Confession, go and sit down or kneel near 
	the priest. He may give you a quick blessing as you are sitting down. You then say: </p>
		<strong>"Bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been ___ months(weeks/years) since my last confession. These are my sins."  
	
		</strong>  
	
</div>


<div class="guide-section">
	
<h3>Confession</h3>	
<p>
	Now, share your sins.<span class="smaller"> If you used the Prepare for Confession section of this app, your 
	sins will appear below. Some have and/or statements and you may only need to 
	say one of the options included.</span></p>
	
	<div id="sinArea">You sins will show up here if you use the "<a href="#prepare">Prepare for Confession</a>" section of this app.</div>
	
	
	<p>
	The priest may ask a clarifying question or two about your sins. He will then give advice and counsel. He will also give some form of penance to do after the confession. It may be a prayer, a meditation, or some action. 
	</p>
	
	
</div>

<div class="guide-section">	
	
<h3>	Act of Contrition:</h3>	

 <p>
	The priest may ask you to say the following prayer. Or, he may ask you to pray it later. 
	
	<p>
	
	<strong>"My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.
                  In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,
                  I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things.
                  I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more,
                  and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.
                  Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.
                  In His name, my God, have mercy.
                  Amen."
	
	</strong>
	
	</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">	
	
	
	<h3>Absolution </h3> 
	
	<p>
	The priest will extend his hand and say the prayer of absolution. Bow your head while he prays and receive the forgiveness of Christ.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		
		The priest may give you a final blessing. If the final prayer ends in "Go in peace".  You respond: 
		<p>		<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
		
		
		
		<p>
		You can thank the priest as you leave.
		</p>

</div><!---end absolution--->

<div class="guide-section">
		<h3>Penance</h3>
		<p>
		If the penance the priest gave you is a prayer or meditation that you can do now, then you can go to a place of prayer and do the penance. Or, if the penance is something you have to do later, remember to do it then. Doing the act of penance completes the Sacrament of Confession.
