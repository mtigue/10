	<h3>Grace</h3>
	<p>The Sacrament of Confession (also called Penance or Reconciliation) is primarily about grace, love, and forgiveness. God loves us unconditionally and is always sending his grace and love to us. </p>
		<p>Every moment, from every direction, grace is being sent to you. However, you 
		decide how open you are to receiving this grace. You can also ask for 
		more grace.</p>
	<p>
	Take a moment now to ask God for more grace and for an awareness of his loving presence.

	<h3>4 Parts to Confession</h3>
	<p><strong>The Sacrament of Confession is made up of four essential parts.</strong></p>
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Sorrow: </strong>In order to be ready for the sacrament of 
	Confession, you need to be sorry for your sins. However, there are two types 
	of being sorry. One: You are afraid of the consequences of having sinned. Two: You really truly feel bad and do not want to sin again. As long as you are at least a little bit sorry 
	in either of these ways, the sacrament will provide you grace and reconciliation.  <br><br>
	</li>
	
<li><strong>Confession: </strong>You have to say your sins out loud to a priest in person. 
<br><br> </li>
<li><strong>Absolution:</strong> The priest says the words of absolution (forgiveness) 
to you.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Penance:</strong> During Confession, the priest will give you 
prayers or actions to do after you leave the confessional. These prayers or actions are a way for you to show God you are sorry and are 
truly willing to change your ways.&nbsp; 
Jesus' death on the cross is what fully makes up for our sins, but doing an act of penance allows us to make an offering with Jesus.</li>	
	</ol>

<p>
<span class="smaller">Sorrow (or repentance) does not mean you know how to avoid sinning again. Repenting simply means you admit you were wrong and are willing to turn back to God. His ongoing grace, if you are open to it, will make you into the type of person that avoids sin in the future. Repenting simply means turning from sin and turning to God in the present tense.</span>

	<h3>Brief History of Confession</h3>
	<p>Why and how did anyone ever begin to confess their sins to a priest in 
	the first place?&nbsp; In John 20:21 Jesus said to his Apostles "Peace be with 
	you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you. Receive the holy Spirit. 
	Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are 
	retained". Jesus gave his Apostles the ability to exercise forgiveness in 
	His name. Only God can forgive sins, but He did give the Aposltes the gift 
	to administer his forgiveness.</p>
	
	<p>
	Early Christians understood that baptism forgives all past sins and 
	initiates us into the family of God. However, there had to be a way for a 
	baptized person to come back into the family of God if he/she ended his/her relationship with God and the 
	Church on purpose (mortal sin). Initally, and even today, the primary 
	purpose of the Sacrament of Confession is to reconcile those who have 
	severed their relationship with God and the Church. 	</p>
	<p>
	However, with time, Christians realized that they could receive the graces 
	of the sacrament of Confession even if they did not completely break their relationship with 
	God. They could go to Confession 
	to repent of lesser offenses (venial sins) and to receive forgiveness, guidance, and the grace to not sin again. 	</p>
	
	<span class="smaller">
	<p><strong>Mortal Sin:</strong> Committing a grave (very serious) offense 
	against God knowing full well that it is a serious offense and knowing that 
	it will declare your relationship with God to be over. Mortal sins intentionally end our relationsihp with God and the Church. Intending such a consequence can be hard to imagine for many people. Often people committ 
	grave offenses but are not fully aware of their gravity or potential 
	consequences. In these cases, a 
	serious commandment was violated, but it did not likely have the effect of breaking 
	one's relationship with God completely. Nevertheless, the primary role of 
	the sacrament of Confession is to reconcile those who have gravely sinned 
	back to God.&nbsp; Commonly understood sins of a grave 
	nature are idolatry, murder, and adultery. Today Catholics are called to 
	receive the sacrament of Confession once per year even if no mortal sins 
	were comitted.</p></span>

	<h3>Do I Need a Priest?</h3>
	
	<p>
The role of the priest in the sacrament of Confession is to stand in the place of and make present the person of Jesus Christ in a mysterious and sacramental way. The priest's role is to extend the healing ministry of Jesus Christ in a personal and concrete way to the person going to confession (<em>the penitent</em>). 
	</p>
	<p>
	Going to a priest is by no means a substitute for personal prayer. The sacrament does not advocate the elimination of a personal conversation with Jesus in favor of the sacrament of Confession. Rather, the sacrament offers a guaranteed encounter with the forgiving ministry of Christ and improves one's personal 
	and communal relationship with Christ. When the Holy Spirit combines the graces of personal prayer and an understanding of the sacrament of confession in one's mind, one finds the same Jesus of the Bible waiting for him/her lovingly in the sacrament of Confession.
	</p>
	<p>
	While standing in the place of Christ, the human nature of the priest also represents to the penitent, the human dimension of the Church. Our sins not only damage our relationship with God but also with all humanity.  By confessing to the priest, the man, you are also admitting your wrong doings to all of humanity in a symbolic way.	</p>

	<h3>Ongoing Grace</h3>

	
	<p>
    Jesus' death on the cross and resurrection from the dead do more than 
	provide forgiveness. The power and grace coming from Jesus' death and 
	resurrection also provides sufficient grace to never sin again. The root of 
	sin is often deep and requires inner healing. Many times we sin not because 
	we are turning from God, but because we felt, in the moment, as if we had nowhere else to turn. Jesus, however, desires more for us. He desires a 
	nearness to us that makes it constantly clear that we can turn to Him and 
	that He will be there. As His grace permeates our lives, we tend to desire 
	sin less and desire God more. Confession is an important gift and tool along 
	this journey. But, like a marriage, our relationship with God is not simply 
	about sin and forgiveness. While sins need to be repented of, God desires a 
	loving, long term, committed relationship with us. And, He has initiated that 
	relationship through his son, Jesus. Take a moment now to turn from your 
	sins and return back to Jesus lovingly in both sacrament and prayer.
	</p>

	...the sacrament of Reconciliation with God brings about a true, "spiritual resurrection," restoration of the dignity and blessings of the life of the children of God, of which the most precious is friendship with God. <span class="smallest">(CCC# 1468, Lk 15:32)</span>

	Great care was taken to remain faithful to the teachings of the Catholic 
	Church when creating this app. However, this app is one of many possible 
	individual reflections on the Sacrament of Confession. No one app could

<div class="guide-section">

<h3>Blessing</h3>

<p>
When it is your turn for 
Confession, sit down in the chair or kneel at the kneeler near the priest. He 
may give you a blessing as you are sitting down. You then say: </p>
		<strong>"Bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been ___ months(weeks/years) since my last confession. These are my sins."  
	
		</strong>  
	
</div>


<div class="guide-section">
	
<h3>Confession</h3>	
<p>
	Now, share your sins.<span class="smaller"> If you used the Prepare for Confession section of this app, your 
	sins will appear below. Some have "and/or" statements and you may only need to 
	say one of the options included.</span></p>
	
	<div id="sinArea">You sins will show up here if you use the "<a href="#prepare">Prepare for Confession</a>" section of this app.</div>
	
	
	<p>
	The priest may ask a clarifying question or two about your sins. He will then give advice and counsel. He will also give some form of penance to do after the confession. It may be a prayer, a meditation, or some action. 
	</p>
	
	
</div>

<div class="guide-section">	
	
<h3>	Act of Contrition:</h3>	

 <p>
	The priest may ask you to say the following prayer. Or, he may ask you to pray it later. 
	
	<p>
	
	<strong>"My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.
                  In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,
                  I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things.
                  I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more,
                  and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.
                  Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.
                  In His name, my God, have mercy.
                  Amen."
	
	</strong>
	
	</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">	
	
	
	<h3>Absolution </h3> 
	
	<p>
	The priest will extend his hand and say the prayer of absolution. Bow your head while he prays and receive the forgiveness of Christ.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		
		The priest may give you a final blessing. If the final 
		blessing ends in "Go in peace," you respond: 
		<p>		<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
		
		
		
		<p>
		You can thank the priest as you leave.
		</p>

</div><!---end absolution--->

<div class="guide-section">
		<h3>Penance</h3>
		<p>
		Remember to do the prayers or acts of penance the priest gave you. Doing the act of penance completes the Sacrament of Confession.
